# Too expensive?

Úll has always been an expensive conference to run, between choice of venue and catering options. This year is no different, and particularly so given the specific setup, and potentially no sponsorship.

That said, we want to encourage both folks for whom €1499 is prohibitive, and also folks who have little to no budget at all.

This will be run as a paid lottery, with pay-what-you-think-its-worth pricing. After the lottery, we will reach out to potential sponsors and donors to see if we can make it work.

If we can’t make it work, we'll refund you the full amount you paid.
