# Úll 2018 FAQ

In 2011, myself and my buddy Eamo put up a teaser website for the second year of a conference we called “Funconf”. The conference sold out on the back of the teaser alone, and it turned out to be amongst the best experiences of my life. Stories of castles, busses, DeLoreans, llamas, storytellers, and deep friendships ensued.

When I started Úll, I wanted it to be a little bit “Funconf”, and a little bit “regular conference”. I think that over the years, this has created a wonderful mix of the expected—rich, engaging keynote-style presentations—and the unexpected—hidden wine tastings, an escape room, sensory audio-visual introspectives, VR but not VR.

The other pattern that emerged whilst designing Úll is that every other year we would try to change the format. After two years in Dublin, we moved to everything-under-one-roof venues in Kilkenny, and then Kerry, and introduced our “special features” … presentations were delivered in rooms around the venue rather than on stage. Two more years in Kerry ensued, where we introduced the storytelling sessions, which added a much more personal element to proceedings. Tick-tock, just like the iPhone.

With “Teach Úll” in 2018, a tick year, I want to go all-in on the unexpected.

Here’s the pitch:

For one week only, tickets will be on sale. Tickets are €1499, including all transportation, meals and two nights of very nice accommodation.

After the week, we will review the ticket sales, and reach out to all of the participants to find out some more information. The idea is to design a conference expressly around the interests, needs, wants, whims and fancies of the individuals who have signed up. A truly personal conference experience.

## Is this like a Kickstarter?

Sort of, except that rather than saying up front what the conference will be, I’m saying upfront that I will make a conference for whomever buys tickets.

## What does “Teach Úll” mean?

It means “Apple house” in Irish. But conveniently it’s also the English word “teach”, and conferences are all about learning.

## When will tickets go on sale?
August 17 until August 24.

## How much will tickets be?
€1499

## Can we bring kids?

Yes. Kids tickets will be €49 each and go towards providing activities for kids in the spirit of the rest of the event.

## Is this a conference?

Yes. No. Sort of.

## How can we trust you?

The last time I did something like this was the best thing I ever organised. You can read more about it here: [http://2011.funconf.com/info]

## Can I buy a ticket without the accommodation portion?
No, it’s all inclusive only.
